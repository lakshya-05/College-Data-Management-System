# College-Data-Management-System
A small Python project using File Handling and Error Handling.


## Use Case:

### Data Management:
The code manages student and faculty data by allowing users to:
- Fill Information: Add new student or faculty records with their respective details (name, roll number/subject, age, college).
- View Information: Display all existing student or faculty records from the respective files.

### Data Storage:
- Student data is stored in a file named "StudentData.txt".
- Faculty data is stored in a file named "FacultyData.txt".

## Key Concepts:

### Error Handling:
- Functions include basic error handling, making the code more robust.
- The code also handles invalid user choices in the main menu.

### File Handeling:
All the data is stored in 2 files named, "StudentData.txt" and "FacultyData.txt".
